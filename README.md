# ATFuzzer
"Opening Pandora's Box through ATFuzzer: Dynamic Analysis of AT Interface for Android Smartphones" is accepted to the 35th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2019.

# Abstract: 
This paper focuses on checking the correctness and robustness of
the AT command interface exposed by the cellular baseband processor through Bluetooth and USB. A deviceâ€™s application processor
uses this interface for issuing high-level commands (or, AT commands) to the baseband processor for performing cellular network
operations (e.g., placing a phone call). Vulnerabilities in this interface can be leveraged by malicious Bluetooth peripherals to launch various attacks including DoS and privacy attacks. To identify such vulnerabilities, we propose ATFuzzer that uses a grammar-guided evolutionary fuzzing approach which mutates production rules of the AT command grammar instead of concrete AT commands. Empirical evaluation with ATFuzzer on 8 Android smartphones from 5 vendors revealed 4 invalid AT command grammars over Bluetooth and 13 over USB with implications ranging from DoS, downgrade of cellular protocol version to severe privacy leaks.

# How to run:
To run ATFuzzer execute the following command:
*./grammarFuzzer.py <list of grammars> <devicename> <port (optional)>*

Alternatively,  it  is  possible  to  execute  ATFuzzer  with  multiple  random  chosen  grammarswith the command:
*./grammarFuzzer.py multi <devicename> <port (optional)>*
 
The program then asks to choose among 4 option:

-0  Standard fuzzer (includes crossover, mutation, feedback evaluation)
-1  No feedback fuzzer
-2  No crossover fuzzer-
-3  No mutation fuzzer

These options allows the user to choose which type of ATFuzzer to run.  This is fundamentalto test and evaluate the effectiveness of our fuzzer.Finally  ATFuzzer  requires  to  specify  which  channel  will  be  used  for  the  AT  commandstransmission.  It is possible to select one among three options:
b. - Bluetooth
u. - USB
t. - Test execution (does not require any connected device)
The test executionexecutes the AT command grammars fuzzer with fake evaluation pa-rameters and without submitting any command to a device.  This option is only for testingpurpose, so do not use it to fuzz an actual smartphone.
